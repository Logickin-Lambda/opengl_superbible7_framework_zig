# This is the next step after a triangle

After I have plotted an triangle, and able to how to take use OpenGL with zig and its dependencies, I decided to a step further with porting the sb7.h from the OpenGL Superbible 7th edition so that I can use zig to learn from the book and trying to figuring how to port code with OOP concept into zig with similar workflow. If I have a working framework, I will separate it from my current project for other future learning project.

Besides, I am trying to replicate the **indexedcube** example from the superbible, to learn about how the vao (vertex array object) and vbo (vertex buffer object) work.
